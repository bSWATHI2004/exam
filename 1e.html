Objective:
1.	Understand distributed version control system
2.	Learn to use Git for local version control
3.	Learn to use GitHub for remote collaboration
4.	Demonstrate commit, branch, merge, and clone operations with examples

Operation	Git Command Example
Init	git init
Add File	git add filename
Commit	git commit -m "message"
Branch	git checkout -b branchname
Merge	git checkout main + git merge branchname
Clone	git clone <repo-url>
Push	git push origin branchname


Understanding Git Commands Used:
Operation	Git Command Example
Initialize Git	git init
Stage Changes	git add filename
Commit Changes	git commit -m "commit message"
Create Branch	git checkout -b new-branch-name
Merge Branch	git merge branch-name
Push to GitHub	git push origin branch-name
Clone Repo	git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

Procedure with Examples:
We'll use a basic HTML portfolio website with a single file: index.html.

1. Initialize a Git Repository Locally (git init)
➤ Steps:
1.	Open Terminal or Git Bash
2.	Create a project folder
mkdir portfolio-site
cd portfolio-site
3.	Initialize Git:
git init
This creates a hidden .git folder inside the directory.

2. Create a Sample HTML File
echo "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>My Portfolio</title></head><body><h1>Welcome!</h1></body></html>" > index.html

3. Commit Changes (git add, git commit)
➤ Steps:
git add index.html
git commit -m "Initial commit: Added basic portfolio page"
This saves the changes to the local repository.

4. Create a New Branch (git branch)
➤ Steps:
git branch about
git checkout about
Or shortcut:
git checkout -b about
You are now working on a separate branch named about.

5. Make Changes on Branch and Commit
Open index.html and add the following before </body>:
<p>This is the about section.</p>
Then:
git add index.html
git commit -m "Added about section"

6. Merge Branch with Main (git merge)
Switch to main branch:
git checkout main
Then merge:
git merge about
Changes from about branch are now merged into main.

7. Push to GitHub (Remote Version Control)
➤ Steps:
1.	Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., portfolio-site)
2.	Connect local repo to GitHub:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/portfolio-site.git
git push -u origin main

8. Clone Repository (git clone)
You can now clone the repository on another system or folder:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/portfolio-site.git
This copies the entire project (including history and branches) to a new location.


Expected Output
•	A repository initialized and committed locally.
•	New branches created and merged.
•	Project pushed to GitHub successfully.
•	Repository cloned from GitHub.

Result
Successfully demonstrated version control operations: commit, branch, merge, and clone using Git and GitHub.

Tips
•	Use git log to see commit history.
•	Use git status to see untracked/modified files.
•	Use git branch -a to list all branches.
